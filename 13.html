		<p>Many people resist going to counseling, even though they may know others who have benefited from interaction with a trained professional. However, if these reluctant folks can be persuaded to seek help, they may find that the experience changes their life. Both adults and children can get advice and support they need in this way.</p>
<p>Counseling often deals with relationships. Husbands and wives, parents and children, teens trying to cope with puberty and school, professional people who deal with co-workers in stressful environments – all of them can encounter problems that hinder their success in life. It is a human tendency to think that problems of this nature are private and should not be shared with strangers.</p>
<p>The need to tell those closest to us about feelings of rejection, inadequacy, or failure is most easily dealt with by avoidance or denial. Many of us find that it is hard to express inner thoughts and turmoil, not all of which we even understand. The thought of bringing a stranger into a difficult situation can be even harder to handle.</p>
<p>However, seeking the help of a trained counselor can be the beginning of positive change. A skillful therapist will know how to help clients express themselves and clarify emotions and behavior patterns that have been making life harder. Even the act of acknowledging the need for help can begin the healing process.</p>
<p>It is easier for many people to talk about their problems in the presence of a counselor. They may feel emboldened to address such things as hurt feelings or unfulfilled expectations when these issues are given specific time and attention. It is easier to confront emotional issues in a clinical setting than in the midst of the rush and stress of daily living.</p>
<p>Counseling comes in many forms. There are group meetings, where those who share a common problem may help each other. Alcoholics, victims of violent crime, and those suffering bereavement often find a support group headed by a trained moderator very effective. Couples may find it easier to talk about issues in the less intimate setting of a group meeting. Teens also often benefit from the support and encouragement of their peers while under the direction of a group leader.</p>
<p>Alternatively, some may prefer to meet one-on-one with a counselor or privately as a couple or family, without having outsiders present. This format may be better for those who have serious problems that require immediate attention – in order to avert divorce, for instance, or to stage an intervention with an addict or someone engaging in harmful or dangerous practices.</p>
<p>There are all sorts of counseling methods and opportunities. People can find faith-based support at a church or mission, help with combat-related issues at a veteran's hospital, advice about family issues at a social services office, or comfort in times of grief or illness by means of a hot-line. The important thing is to know that there is help available for those who are wise enough to seek it.</p>
