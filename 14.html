		<p>A Psychiatrist is a medical professional who specializes in diagnosing and treating a variety of mental disorders. Sometimes, when a person is sick, the cause of illness may not be physical. However, the person may experience somatic symptoms as a result of mental illness. Psychiatrists or analysts evaluate their patients to determine if their symptoms are influenced by mental sickness, physical sickness, or both.</p>
<p>In order to evaluate patients, the doctor may carry out a psychiatric examination as well as a physical exam. Brain imaging, such as the use of CAT scans or MRIs, may also be used to diagnosis ailments. Ordering a series of blood tests is also common. Once the underlying cause of illness has been determined, they may prescribe medication such as sedatives, relaxants or some other type of anti-depressant.</p>
<p>Doctors may also prescribe psychotherapy for patients when they feel this is appropriate. Psychotherapy is a therapeutic form of treatment that involves positive interactions between the patient, their medical professional, and often, another group of people. The aim is to explore specific thoughts and feelings and lead to negative behavior.</p>
<p>If this career path appeals to you, there are several steps you will need to take in order to become a psychiatrist. It typically takes about twelve years to become qualified after you complete high school. You must first obtain an undergraduate degree, preferably in a science or social science subject such as sociology or psychology. You will then need to study for a Doctor of Medicine degree or a Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine degree.</p>
<p>These studies are followed by a psychiatric residency term which last four years. This is the time where you receive a lot of hands on work with patients. During residency you will receive training in psychiatric diagnosis and psychopharmacology. You will also learn about medical care issues and various psychotherapies which doctors in your field routinely use.</p>
<p>Residents are usually required to undertake a minimum of four months postgraduate training in internal medicine or pediatrics. They must also complete a two month internship in neurology during the first year of residency. After you complete your training, you will be eligible to sit a specialty board examination and become board certified.</p>
<p>Once you are board certified, you can specialize in any number of fields of psychiatry, depending on what interests you. If you want to help to help people who are struggling with addiction, you can specialize in addiction psychiatry. If you want to help children with psychological disorders, or those who are the victims of abuse, then you may want to consider child and adolescent psychiatry.</p>
<p>Before choosing to become a Psychiatrist, evaluate yourself and whether you would be good in this field. You should ask yourself whether you have a solid understanding of mathematics and biological sciences. It is also important to have strong aptitude in courses such as sociology or psychology. You will likely need to carry out a lot of research as well. Finally, ensure that you are someone that people can trust, since analysts are often told intimate and personal details of the lives of their patients.</p>
