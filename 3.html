		<p>Individuals who are interested in helping others may be interested in going into the counseling field. There is always a need for individuals who can empathize and help people make better choices in their life. Counselors should not expect to make a significant amount of money but enjoy the reward of helping others.</p>
<p>There are many different areas where counselors are needed such as the school systems, public health and mental health clinics. One popular area where counselors are always needed is in the senior living population. Many seniors need help from these individuals to continue living at homes. Many seniors fall on difficult times where they become depressed after losing a companion and really need someone who will listen to their concerns.</p>
<p>Most people regardless of who they are and what they are going through just need someone they can confide in and will listen without being judgmental. Counselors are trained professionals who know exactly how to deal with people who are under duress. School counselors are required to have their Masters degree, this means these individuals are highly qualified and trained to work with students.</p>
<p>Counselors can also be set up in nursing facilities. Most nursing facilities have individuals with high levels of depression, especially from seniors who are just arriving. Counseling sessions can help some of these elderly individuals better cope with the transition. These sessions can also help senior adults better manage their emotions and find support from other residents as well as enjoyment in their new life.</p>
<p>People who have been diagnosed with terminally ill conditions usually need help coping with their diagnosis. Many times their family members also need someone who will listen and help them deal with what they are feeling. Therapy can be very beneficial for these individuals. Therapists can help these individuals come to terms with the diagnosis and prepare for the future.</p>
<p>Therapists not only listen to people talk about their problems they help these individuals make plans to improve their life. These individuals are helped with setting goals and guidance on how to achieve them. Clients of counselors also receive help with finding different types of programs or services that will improve their situation. Counselors can usually get people in doors that have been closed to the public for months. The profession is one that is highly looked upon in most communities.</p>
<p>Individuals who are having problems finding jobs or staying employed can look to career counseling. These professionals help people decide on what they want to do with their lives. Most of these workers can be found in universities. They work hard to help students get on the right track by helping them choose the appropriate classes for their major.</p>
<p>If you are looking for a field where you can make a difference in a persons life then this is definitely the field. Through therapy a person will gradually begin to see their situation improve. Most people just need to have someone there for them who really care about their well being and want nothing but the best for them.</p>
