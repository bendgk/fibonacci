		<p>The Psychiatrist NYC is a medical doctor who then chose psychiatry as his or her specialty. Unlike the psychologist, who has a doctorate, the psychiatrist, who is a licensed MD, can prescribe medication for his or her patients. Counseling is a very helpful thing for the person with less than good mental health. Sometimes, however, help must extend beyond talk therapy.</p>
<p>There are those mental health issues that cause a person to lose touch with reality. You may have observed a man walking down the street, talking animatedly, but no one is walking with him and listening to what he is saying. This individual would be considered out of touch with reality.</p>
<p>Psychotic behavior such as this, makes it mandatory to prescribe some sort of medication that will improve that condition. It may not cure the psychosis, but will serve to calm him down. This is a definite advantage because it may make it less stressful for him and improve his quality of life. It may also make it easier for the family to care for him.</p>
<p>One psychotic mental illness is schizophrenia. The person who is suffering from this condition will have delusions such as the government is tracking him down, or radio waves are trying to enter his brain and make him do things. Sometimes the schizophrenic will cover windows with tin foil to keep out such intruders.</p>
<p>There is no easy way to communicate with this individual or make him recognize reality. The Psychiatrist NYC will prescribe medication that will improve, if not completely rectify, his mental state. Counseling may or may not have any effect on him. Often, institutionalization is the only solution.</p>
<p>The mental illness referred to as manic depressive causes an individual to have radical mood swings. One day she may be acting happy to the point of being histrionic. The next, she may be so sad and depressed that she is barely able to get out of bed. It is difficult to hold a job, or have a semblance of stability in her life.</p>
<p>There are now prescription medications that can make her condition stable. There may be some unusual traits that are not eradicated. However, she will be in touch with reality and capable of functioning in society in some capacity.</p>
<p>It is unfortunate, but, when a prescription medication is successful, the individual may think she does not need it any more. She stops taking it, possibly because it makes her too drowsy. After the medication is out of her system, the original mental health issue returns full force.</p>
<p>If the psychiatrist diagnoses someone and finds he or she has suicidal tendencies, hospitalization may be the only answer. If left on her own, she may carry out a plan to end her life. An illness that could have been alleviated and overcome with care, is instead a death sentence.</p>
<p>There are only two circumstances in which a Psychiatrist NYC can breach patient confidentiality. If he is a danger to himself, in other words suicidal, or if he is planning to murder someone or do some sort of serious harm to a group of people. In all other cases, the doctor-patient confidentiality cannot be broken. This allows a patient to freely discuss all his feelings and anxieties with his psychiatrist, without fear of being exposed for having some detrimental mental condition.</p>
