		<p>Psychiatrist is the title given to a physician with a specialty in psychiatry, which is the diagnosis and treatment of various mental disorders. These individuals are medical doctors who are responsible for evaluating their patients to determine if the symptoms they have are the results of a medical illness, combination of mental and medical illnesses, or strictly a mental problem.</p>
<p>In order to their job, these professionals utilize the psychiatric exam, brain imaging, MRI, PET, brain imaging, blood laboratories, and physical exam. These doctors are able to prescribe medicine to their patients, if they deem it to be necessary in regulating their state of mind. They might also employ psychotherapy.</p>
<p>There are numerous subspecialties that exist within this field. These each require additional and separate training, which must be certified in the United States. Some examples of the other specialties that exist in this field: brain injury, geriatric psychiatry, pain medicine, addiction psychiatry, palliative and hospice medicine, clinical neurophysiology, adolescent and child psychiatry and more.</p>
<p>Some of these professionals are focused on working with specific age groups. Such is the case of pediatric, or child and adolescent, psychiatrists. These individuals work solely with kids and teenagers in working on psychological problems. People who work with older individuals are classified as geropsychiatrists. Individuals who practice in the workplace are categorized as organization or occupation in America and many parts of the United Kingdom. Those who work in courtrooms and report to the jury and judge in civil and criminal cases are called forensic psychiatrists. They are also given the job of treating mentally disordered offenders and other patients who have conditions in which they must be treated within secure units.</p>
<p>Requirements to work in this profession will vary based on the country. Still, all parts of the world require that individuals have a medical degree in order to practice on a professional level. This is especially important because of the relationships that must be built between the physician and his or her clients. Also, these doctors have great power that must be handled with care and sensitivity.</p>
<p>Generally, these individuals are expected to be patient. They must work with many people who are unstable in different capacities. Being patient is an ideal characteristic of a psychiatrist. Furthermore, these professionals are expected to have an analytical mind. In many instances, these people may have to have a Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine or Doctor of Medicine degree.</p>
<p>This is considered one of the oldest specialties in medicine. Recent advances in technology and neuroscience have improved the diagnostic and treatment process when it comes to mental illnesses and disorders. The average psychiatrist spends a lot of time at work, approximately 60 percent of this time is with patients. Most patients are outpatient and the rest may been seen at hospitals or other similar settings. Psychiatric hospitalization is known for being more focused and intense.</p>
<p>A psychiatrist is a doctor who specializes in the field of medicine known as psychiatry. They are responsible for diagnosing and treating mental disorders found in people of all ages. Furthermore, these physicians evaluate the condition of their patients through a variety of tests and processes.</p>
